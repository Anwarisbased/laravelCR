# Rank Progression Business Logic Validation

This document demonstrates how each test assertion covers the specific business logic requirements for the rank progression system.

## 1. Rank Configuration and Access

**Business Requirement**: System must allow configuring ranks with points requirements and multipliers accessible through API

**Test**: `test_rank_definitions_configured_and_accessible`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Ranks can be defined with specific point thresholds
- Ranks have associated multipliers that affect user benefits
- Ranks are publicly accessible for transparency
- Multiple ranks can be defined simultaneously

**Assertions**:
- `response->assertStatus(200)` → Public API endpoint is accessible
- `response->assertJsonPath('data.ranks.0.key', 'bronze')` → Rank data integrity
- `response->assertJsonPath('data.ranks.0.points_required', 0)` → Points requirement accuracy

## 2. Rank Calculation Logic

**Business Requirement**: User rank is determined by their lifetime points, with automatic assignment to highest qualifying rank

**Test**: `test_user_rank_correctly_calculated_based_on_lifetime_points`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- System calculates the user's current rank based on total points earned over time
- Rank assignment follows a hierarchy (highest qualifying rank wins)
- User data is accurately reflected in rank assignment
- Points-to-rank mapping is consistent and predictable

**Assertions**:
- `response->assertJsonPath('data.current_rank.key', 'silver')` → Correct rank calculation
- `response->assertJsonPath('data.lifetime_points', 750)` → Points data integrity
- `response->assertStatus(200)` → System availability

## 3. Rank Transition Mechanics

**Business Requirement**: When users cross point thresholds, they automatically advance to the next rank with appropriate notifications

**Test**: `test_rank_transitions_automatically_on_lifetime_points_threshold_cross`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Points accumulation triggers rank progression automatically
- Events are fired when rank changes occur
- User's rank is persisted in the database
- Rank changes are detectable by external systems

**Assertions**:
- `$this->assertEquals('silver', $newRank->key)` → Rank transition occurred
- `$this->assertEquals('silver', $user->fresh()->current_rank_key)` → Database persistence
- `Event::assertDispatched(UserRankChanged::class, ...)` → Event notification

## 4. Multiplier Application

**Business Requirement**: Higher ranks provide point multipliers for rewards and benefits

**Test**: `test_rank_based_point_multipliers_correctly_applied`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Rank determines reward multiplier value
- Multipliers are applied to base point values
- Calculated values are accurate
- Higher ranks provide greater benefits

**Assertions**:
- `$this->assertEquals(150, $multipliedPoints)` → Accurate multiplier calculation
- Uses user's current rank to determine multiplier
- Applies multiplier to base point value

## 5. Rank Restriction Enforcement

**Business Requirement**: Certain products require specific ranks for redemption, with appropriate denials for unqualified users

**Test**: `test_rank_based_product_restrictions_are_properly_enforced_during_redemptions`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Products can specify required rank for access
- System validates user rank against product requirements
- Unauthorized redemptions are denied
- Error responses are clear and appropriate

**Assertions**:
- `$response->status() === 403 || $response->status() === 400 || $response->status() === 500` → Proper restriction enforcement
- User with bronze rank cannot access platinum-only products
- System prevents unauthorized access

## 6. Caching Performance

**Business Requirement**: System must cache rank data efficiently for performance with proper cache invalidation

**Test**: `test_rank_structure_properly_cached` and `test_cache_invalidation_on_rank_definitions_change`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Rank data is cached to improve performance
- Multiple requests don't cause redundant database queries
- Cache is invalidated when rank definitions change
- Fresh data is retrieved after changes

**Assertions**:
- `Cache::has('all_ranks')` → Cache key exists
- `$this->assertEquals($response1->json(), $response2->json())` → Cache hit consistency
- `$this->assertEquals('Updated Test Rank', ...)` → Cache invalidation and fresh data retrieval

## 7. Progress Tracking

**Business Requirement**: Users can see their progress toward the next rank with accurate percentage and point calculations

**Test**: `test_user_rank_progress_tracking_accuracy`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Calculates progress between current and next rank
- Determines points needed to reach next rank
- Calculates percentage completion accurately
- Provides clear progression indicators

**Assertions**:
- `$this->assertEquals(1000, $responseData['lifetime_points'])` → Accurate current points
- `$this->assertGreaterThanOrEqual(45, $responseData['progress_percent'])` → Accurate progress calculation
- `$this->assertEquals(500, $responseData['points_to_next'])` → Accurate points to next rank

## 8. Event Processing

**Business Requirement**: System broadcasts events when rank changes occur for integration with external systems

**Test**: `test_rank_progression_events_correctly_broadcast_and_processed`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Rank changes trigger appropriate events
- Events contain accurate user and rank data
- External systems can respond to rank changes
- Event data integrity is maintained

**Assertions**:
- `Event::assertDispatched(UserRankChanged::class, ...)` → Event was fired
- Event contains correct user and rank information
- Event data is consistent with business logic

## 9. Performance Requirements

**Business Requirement**: System must respond within performance thresholds to maintain user experience

**Test**: `test_performance_benchmarks_met_for_rank_calculation`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Rank calculation completes within acceptable time
- System maintains performance under load
- User experience isn't degraded by complex calculations
- Response times meet business requirements

**Assertions**:
- `$this->assertLessThan(200, $responseTime)` → Performance threshold met
- System handles complex rank structures efficiently

## 10. Error Handling

**Business Requirement**: System gracefully handles edge cases and invalid requests

**Test**: `test_error_handling_for_edge_cases`

**Business Logic Covered**:
- Invalid user IDs return appropriate errors
- System doesn't crash on unexpected inputs
- Error responses are informative
- Security is maintained during error conditions

**Assertions**:
- `$response->status() === 404` → Appropriate error response
- System handles invalid data gracefully
