# CannaRewards Laravel Port - Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating the CannaRewards system from the current WordPress/WooCommerce implementation to a new Laravel-based architecture.

## Migration Approach

### Blue-Green Deployment Strategy
We will employ a blue-green deployment approach to minimize downtime and risk during the migration:

1. **Blue Environment**: Current WordPress/WooCommerce implementation
2. **Green Environment**: New Laravel implementation
3. **Traffic Switch**: Gradual traffic shifting from blue to green
4. **Rollback Plan**: Immediate rollback capability to blue environment

### Phased Migration
The migration will occur in phases to ensure stability and minimize business disruption:

1. **Phase 1**: Dual Running (Weeks 1-4)
   - Both systems operate in parallel
   - New user registrations directed to Laravel
   - Existing users continue on WordPress
   - Data synchronization between systems

2. **Phase 2**: Gradual Transition (Weeks 5-8)
   - Existing users migrated in batches
   - Feature parity validation
   - Performance monitoring and optimization

3. **Phase 3**: Full Cutover (Weeks 9-10)
   - Complete migration to Laravel
   - Decommissioning of WordPress components
   - Final validation and optimization

## Data Migration

### Migration Principles
1. **Data Integrity**: Zero data loss during migration
2. **Atomic Operations**: All-or-nothing migration for individual entities
3. **Validation**: Pre and post-migration data validation
4. **Rollback Capability**: Ability to revert migrated data if needed

### Data Entities to Migrate

#### Users (High Priority)
- User accounts and metadata
- Points balances and lifetime points
- Rank information
- Referral codes and relationships
- Shipping addresses
- Custom field values
- Action logs (scan history, redemptions)

#### Products (Medium Priority)
- Product definitions
- Point awards and costs
- Rank requirements
- Metadata and attributes

#### Configuration (High Priority)
- Rank definitions
- Achievement definitions
- Custom field definitions
- Trigger definitions
- Brand settings

#### Historical Data (Medium Priority)
- Order history
- Achievement unlocks
- Referral conversions
- System logs

### Migration Process

#### 1. Preparation Phase
- Create comprehensive data mapping document
- Develop migration scripts for each entity type
- Set up parallel databases (if needed)
- Create backup and rollback procedures
- Establish validation criteria

#### 2. Script Development
- Develop ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts
- Implement data validation and reconciliation
- Create progress tracking and error handling
- Build rollback capabilities

#### 3. Testing Phase
- Test migration scripts with sample data
- Validate data integrity post-migration
- Performance test migration process
- Document any issues and resolutions

#### 4. Execution Phase
- Execute migration in controlled batches
- Monitor progress and performance
- Validate data at each checkpoint
- Handle errors and exceptions

## Technical Migration Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
- Provision new Laravel application servers
- Configure database clusters
- Set up caching layers (Redis)
- Configure load balancers
- Establish monitoring and alerting

### 2. Code Deployment
- Deploy Laravel application to staging environment
- Conduct comprehensive testing
- Deploy to production environment
- Configure blue-green routing

### 3. Data Migration Execution
- Execute user data migration in batches
- Migrate product and configuration data
- Validate migrated data
- Handle any discrepancies

### 4. Traffic Shifting
- Gradually shift traffic to new system
- Monitor performance and error rates
- Adjust traffic distribution based on metrics
- Complete full cutover when stable

## Integration Points

### WordPress API Compatibility
To ensure a smooth transition, the Laravel system will maintain API compatibility with the existing WordPress implementation:

1. **Endpoint Parity**: All existing API endpoints will be replicated
2. **Response Format**: JSON response formats will remain consistent
3. **Authentication**: JWT token compatibility will be maintained
4. **Error Handling**: Error response formats will be consistent

### Third-Party Integrations
All existing third-party integrations will be maintained:

1. **WooCommerce**: Product and order data access patterns will be preserved
2. **Customer.io**: Event tracking and user data synchronization will continue
3. **Payment Gateways**: Existing payment processing workflows will be maintained
4. **Analytics**: Data tracking and reporting will continue uninterrupted

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks

#### 1. Data Loss
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backups, validation scripts, atomic operations
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Low

#### 2. Performance Degradation
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing, gradual rollout, monitoring
- **Impact**: Medium
- **Probability**: Medium

#### 3. User Experience Disruption
- **Mitigation**: Feature parity, user testing, gradual migration
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Low

#### 4. Extended Downtime
- **Mitigation**: Blue-green deployment, rollback procedures
- **Impact**: High
- **Probability**: Low

### Contingency Plans

#### Immediate Rollback
- If critical issues are detected, immediately redirect traffic to WordPress
- Maintain both systems in parallel until issues are resolved
- Communicate with users about temporary service adjustments

#### Data Recovery
- Maintain database snapshots throughout migration
- Implement point-in-time recovery procedures
- Validate data integrity continuously

#### Performance Optimization
- Monitor system metrics in real-time
- Implement auto-scaling for Laravel components
- Optimize database queries and indexing

## Testing Strategy

### Pre-Migration Testing
- Data migration scripts validation
- Performance benchmarking
- Security auditing
- User acceptance testing

### During Migration Testing
- Continuous data validation
- Real-time performance monitoring
- User experience monitoring
- Error rate tracking

### Post-Migration Testing
- Comprehensive functionality testing
- Data integrity verification
- Performance validation
- Security assessment

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication
- Daily standups during active migration
- Weekly progress reports to stakeholders
- Immediate escalation procedures for critical issues
- Post-mortem analysis after completion

### External Communication
- Advance notice to users about maintenance windows
- Real-time status updates during migration
- Post-migration communication about improvements
- Support team preparation for potential user questions

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success Metrics
- Zero data loss during migration
- < 5 minute total downtime during cutover
- API response times maintained or improved
- System stability > 99.9% uptime
- Successful third-party integration continuity

### Business Success Metrics
- User satisfaction scores maintained or improved
- No significant increase in support tickets
- Successful completion within planned timeline
- Budget adherence
- Positive feedback from development team on new architecture

## Rollback Procedures

### Partial Rollback
If issues are detected with specific components:
1. Redirect traffic for affected components back to WordPress
2. Isolate and debug issues in Laravel components
3. Deploy fixes and re-attempt migration

### Full Rollback
If critical issues affect the entire system:
1. Immediately redirect all traffic to WordPress
2. Assess and document all issues
3. Develop remediation plan
4. Schedule re-attempt of migration
