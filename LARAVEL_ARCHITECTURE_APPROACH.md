# Pure Laravel Implementation Approach for CannaRewards

## Overview
This document outlines a pure Laravel implementation approach for the CannaRewards system, eliminating all WordPress dependencies and leveraging Laravel's native features and ecosystem.

## Core Philosophy
Instead of porting WordPress-dependent components, we will rebuild the system using Laravel's native patterns and features:
- Leverage Laravel's Eloquent ORM instead of WordPress database abstractions
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication instead of WordPress user system
- Implement Laravel's event system instead of custom event buses
- Use Laravel's queue system for background processing
- Leverage Laravel's caching system for performance optimization
- Utilize Laravel's testing framework for comprehensive test coverage

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Domain-Driven Design with Laravel
We'll implement a layered architecture using Laravel's features:
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Requests**: Laravel Form Request validation
- **Resources**: Laravel API Resources for response formatting
- **Services**: Application services for business logic
- **Models**: Eloquent models for data persistence
- **Repositories**: Repository pattern for data access (optional but recommended)
- **Events**: Laravel Events for domain events
- **Jobs**: Laravel Jobs for background processing
- **Notifications**: Laravel Notifications for user communications

### 2. Laravel-Native Replacements for WordPress Features

| WordPress Feature | Laravel Replacement | Benefits |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------|
| Custom Post Types | Eloquent Models | Native ORM with relationships |
| WordPress Hooks | Laravel Events | Built-in event system with queue support |
| Transients/Caching | Laravel Cache | Multiple drivers (Redis, Memcached, File) |
| User Meta | Eloquent Relationships | Native relationship handling |
| wp_options | Laravel Config | Environment-based configuration |
| Cron Jobs | Laravel Scheduler | Reliable scheduling with monitoring |
| wp_mail | Laravel Mail | Multiple mail drivers, queuing |
| REST API | Laravel API Resources | Built-in JSON:API support |

### 3. Core Laravel Components to Utilize

#### a) Eloquent ORM
- Replace WordPress database abstractions with Eloquent models
- Use relationships for user meta, custom fields, etc.
- Leverage eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Use mutators/accessors for data transformation

#### b) Laravel Events
- Replace custom event bus with Laravel Events
- Use event listeners for cross-cutting concerns
- Leverage queued events for performance
- Use event subscribers for related event handling

#### c) Laravel Queues
- Offload background processing to queues
- Use Redis or database queues for reliability
- Implement failed job handling and retries
- Monitor queue performance

#### d) Laravel Cache
- Replace WordPress transients with Laravel cache
- Use Redis for distributed caching
- Implement cache tagging for granular invalidation
- Use cache warming for performance

#### e) Laravel Authentication
- Use Laravel Passport or Sanctum for API authentication
- Implement JWT tokens with built-in features
- Leverage Laravel's password reset functionality
- Use Laravel's rate limiting for security

### 4. New Vertical Slice Structure for Laravel

- Rank eligibility checks

#### Slice 4: Referral System
- Referral code generation
- Referral tracking
- Bonus awarding
- Conversion processing

#### Slice 5: Gamification Engine
- Achievement models
- Unlocking logic
- Progress tracking
- Reward distribution

#### Slice 6: Reward Catalog

- Status tracking

#### Slice 8: Dashboard & Analytics
- User dashboard data
- Points history
- Engagement metrics
- Personalized insights

#### Slice 9: Administration
- Laravel Nova or custom admin panel
- Configuration management
- Reporting dashboard
- Merchant tools

#### Slice 10: Events & Notifications
- Event broadcasting

#### Slice 11: Rules Engine
- Conditional logic processing
- Achievement criteria
- Trigger evaluation
- Dynamic rule management

#### Slice 12: Infrastructure & Operations
- Queue workers
- Scheduled tasks
- Monitoring
- Logging
- Performance optimization

- Validate data integrity during migration
- Implement rollback procedures
- Conduct dry runs before production migration

### 4. Gradual Rollout
- Deploy alongside existing WordPress system
- Route traffic gradually to new system
- Monitor performance and error rates
- Complete cutover when stable
