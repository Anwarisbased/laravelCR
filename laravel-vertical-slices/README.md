# Laravel Vertical Slices

## Overview
This directory contains the definition of vertical slices for the CannaRewards Laravel port project. Each file represents a vertical slice that cuts through all layers of the application, from API endpoints to domain logic to infrastructure.

## Vertical Slices

1. [Authentication & User Management](01-authentication-user-management.md) - User authentication, registration, and account management
2. [Product Economy](02-product-economy.md) - Core points economy including scanning and claiming mechanics
3. [Rank Progression](03-rank-progression.md) - Loyalty tier system and rank calculations
4. [Referral System](04-referral-system.md) - Referral program with code generation and bonus awarding
5. [Gamification Engine](05-gamification-engine.md) - Achievement system with unlocking logic and rewards
6. [Reward Catalog](06-reward-catalog.md) - Product listings and eligibility checking
7. [Order Management](07-order-management.md) - Redemption processing and order history
8. [Dashboard & Analytics](08-dashboard-analytics.md) - User insights and statistics presentation
9. [Administration Panel](09-administration-panel.md) - Admin configuration and management interface
10. [Event & Notification System](10-event-notification-system.md) - Event broadcasting and user communications
11. [Infrastructure & Operations](11-infrastructure-operations.md) - System monitoring, maintenance, and operations
12. [Testing Strategy](12-testing-strategy.md) - Comprehensive testing approach for all functionality

## Implementation Approach

Each vertical slice is designed to be independently implementable while maintaining consistency with the overall architectural vision. The slices follow these principles:

1. **Business Capability Focus**: Each slice represents a cohesive business capability rather than technical layers.
2. **Full Stack Implementation**: Each slice includes all necessary components from API to domain to infrastructure.
3. **Test-Driven Definition**: Each slice includes a Definition of Done with specific test references.
4. **Incremental Delivery**: Slices can be implemented and delivered incrementally while maintaining system integrity.

## Pure Laravel Architecture

Unlike the previous approach which attempted to port WordPress components, these vertical slices embrace a pure Laravel implementation:

1. **Laravel-Native Components**: Utilizing Laravel's built-in features rather than porting external systems
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Leveraging Laravel Events for domain event handling
3. **Queue Processing**: Using Laravel Queues for background job processing
4. **Caching Strategies**: Implementing Laravel Cache for performance optimization
5. **Authentication Systems**: Leveraging Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
6. **Database ORM**: Using Eloquent ORM instead of direct database queries
7. **Validation Engine**: Utilizing Laravel Form Requests for input validation
8. **Notification System**: Using Laravel Notifications for user communications
9. **Testing Framework**: Implementing comprehensive test coverage with PHPUnit and Laravel testing helpers
10. **Deployment Automation**: Using Laravel Envoyer for zero-downtime deployments
11. **Server Management**: Using Laravel Forge for infrastructure provisioning
12. **Monitoring Tools**: Leveraging Laravel Horizon and Telescope for system monitoring

## Development Process

1. **Slice Selection**: Choose a vertical slice based on business priority and technical feasibility.
2. **Definition Review**: Review the slice definition and Definition of Done.
3. **Implementation**: Implement the slice following Laravel best practices and the defined architecture.
4. **Testing**: Ensure all tests referenced in the Definition of Done pass.
5. **Integration**: Integrate the slice with existing functionality.
6. **Verification**: Verify the slice works correctly in the broader system context.

## Architecture Alignment

All vertical slices align with the pure Laravel architecture including:

- **Service-Oriented Monolith**: Single Laravel application with well-defined service boundaries
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Laravel Events for inter-service communication
- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction using Eloquent
- **Command Pattern**: Business operations encapsulation
- **Value Objects**: Domain concept validation and type safety
- **DTOs**: Data transfer and response formatting
- **Form Request Pattern**: Input validation and authorization
- **Responder Pattern**: HTTP response handling
- **Dependency Injection**: Laravel service container for loose coupling
- **Queues**: Background job processing with Laravel Queues
- **Caching**: Performance optimization with Laravel Cache
- **Notifications**: User communications with Laravel Notifications

## Testing Strategy

Each vertical slice includes references to specific tests that validate the functionality. The testing strategy includes:

1. **Unit Tests**: Direct testing of individual components and business logic
2. **Feature Tests**: Testing of API endpoints and complete workflows
3. **Integration Tests**: Testing of service interactions and external integrations
4. **Browser Tests**: End-to-end testing of user interfaces with Laravel Dusk
5. **Console Tests**: Testing of Artisan commands and scheduled tasks
6. **Notification Tests**: Testing of notification delivery and content
7. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarks for response times and throughput
8. **Security Tests**: Validation of authentication, authorization, and data protection

This approach ensures that each vertical slice can be developed and tested independently while maintaining confidence in the overall system correctness.

## Migration Strategy

Rather than attempting to port existing WordPress code, the recommended approach is to rebuild using these vertical slices with TDD:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests based on existing functionality requirements
2. **API Compatibility**: Maintain exact API endpoint compatibility with existing clients
3. **Data Migration**: Create migration scripts for existing user data and transaction history
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Deploy alongside existing system and route traffic gradually
5. **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor performance and error rates during transition
6. **Completion**: Full cutover when new system proves stable and reliable

This approach leverages Laravel's strengths while eliminating all WordPress dependencies, resulting in a more maintainable, scalable, and performant system.
