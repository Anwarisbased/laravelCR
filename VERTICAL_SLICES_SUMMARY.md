# CannaRewards Laravel Port - Vertical Slices Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the vertical slice approach for migrating the CannaRewards system from WordPress/WooCommerce to Laravel. The approach divides the system into 12 distinct vertical slices, each representing a complete business capability that cuts through all architectural layers.

## Vertical Slice Inventory

| # | Slice Name | Key Components | API Endpoints | Estimated Complexity |
|---|------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1 | [User Authentication & Registration](vertical-slices/01-user-authentication.md) | UserService, UserRepository, AuthController | 6 endpoints | Medium |
| 2 | [Product Scanning & Claim Processing](vertical-slices/02-product-scanning.md) | EconomyService, ProductRepository, ScanController | 2 endpoints | High |
| 3 | [Point Management & Economy](vertical-slices/03-point-management.md) | EconomyService, UserRepository, RedeemController | 3 endpoints | High |
| 4 | [Referral System](vertical-slices/04-referral-system.md) | ReferralService, UserRepository, ReferralController | 2 endpoints | Medium |
| 5 | [Gamification & Achievements](vertical-slices/05-gamification.md) | GamificationService, AchievementRepository | 0 endpoints | Medium |
| 6 | [Rank Progression & Tier System](vertical-slices/06-rank-progression.md) | RankService, UserRepository | 2 endpoints | Medium |
| 7 | [Reward Catalog & Product Management](vertical-slices/07-reward-catalog.md) | CatalogService, ProductRepository | 2 endpoints | Low |
| 8 | [User Profile Management](vertical-slices/08-user-profile.md) | UserService, UserRepository, ProfileController | 2 endpoints | Medium |
| 9 | [Order History & Redemption Tracking](vertical-slices/09-order-history.md) | OrderRepository, OrdersController | 1 endpoint | Low |
|10 | [Dashboard Analytics & User Insights](vertical-slices/10-dashboard-analytics.md) | UserService, ActionLogService | 2 endpoints | Low |
|11 | [Admin Configuration & Management](vertical-slices/11-admin-configuration.md) | Admin services, ConfigService | 0 endpoints | High |
|12 | [Infrastructure & Cross-cutting Concerns](vertical-slices/12-infrastructure.md) | Container, EventBus, Router | Various | High |

## Implementation Priority

Based on business value and technical dependencies, the recommended implementation order is:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Vertical Slices 12, 1, 2)
1. **Infrastructure & Cross-cutting Concerns** - Core system foundation
2. **User Authentication & Registration** - Essential for any user interaction
3. **Product Scanning & Claim Processing** - Core business functionality

### Phase 2: Core Economy (Vertical Slices 3, 6, 7)
1. **Point Management & Economy** - Core monetization system
2. **Rank Progression & Tier System** - User engagement driver
3. **Reward Catalog & Product Management** - Essential for redemptions

### Phase 3: User Experience (Vertical Slices 8, 9, 10)
1. **User Profile Management** - Personalization features
2. **Order History & Redemption Tracking** - User transparency
3. **Dashboard Analytics & User Insights** - Engagement metrics

### Phase 4: Growth Features (Vertical Slices 4, 5, 11)
1. **Referral System** - User acquisition driver
2. **Gamification & Achievements** - Engagement enhancement
3. **Admin Configuration & Management** - Business control panel

## Testing Coverage Map

Each vertical slice includes specific test references in its Definition of Done:

| Slice | Component Tests | Integration Tests | End-to-End Tests | Contract Tests |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| User Authentication | ✅ UserService tests | ✅ API endpoint tests | ✅ User journey tests | ✅ OpenAPI validation |
| Product Scanning | ✅ Economy component tests | ✅ Scan endpoint tests | ✅ Onboarding flow tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Point Management | ✅ Economy component tests | ✅ Redemption tests | ✅ Economy flow tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Referral System | ✅ Component harness tests | ✅ Referral API tests | ✅ Referral journey tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Gamification | ✅ Component harness tests | ✅ Achievement tests | ✅ Gamification flow tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Rank Progression | ✅ Rank service tests | ✅ Rank API tests | ✅ Rank progression tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Reward Catalog | ✅ Catalog service tests | ✅ Catalog API tests | N/A | ✅ API contract validation |
| User Profile | ✅ UserService tests | ✅ Profile API tests | ✅ Profile update tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Order History | ✅ Order repository tests | ✅ Order API tests | ✅ Onboarding flow tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Dashboard Analytics | ✅ UserService tests | ✅ Dashboard API tests | ✅ User journey tests | ✅ API contract validation |
| Admin Configuration | ✅ Integration tests | ✅ Admin UI tests | N/A | N/A |
| Infrastructure | ✅ Container tests | ✅ Integration tests | N/A | N/A |

## Dependencies Between Slices

Understanding dependencies is crucial for proper implementation sequencing:

### Hard Dependencies (Must be implemented first)
1. **Infrastructure** → All other slices
2. **User Authentication** → Product Scanning, Point Management, Profile Management
3. **Product Scanning** → Point Management (for point granting)

### Soft Dependencies (Enhances functionality)
1. **Rank Progression** → Product Scanning (point multipliers), Point Management (redemption restrictions)
2. **Referral System** → User Authentication (referral codes), Product Scanning (conversion tracking)
3. **Gamification** → Product Scanning (achievement triggers), Point Management (reward distribution)

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Development Team Structure
- **Lead Architect**: Oversees cross-cutting concerns and architectural integrity
- **Backend Developers (3)**: Implement core domain logic and services
- **Frontend Developer**: Ensures API compatibility with existing clients
- **DevOps Engineer**: Manages deployment pipeline and infrastructure
- **QA Engineer**: Validates testing coverage and quality assurance

### Technology Stack Distribution
- **Laravel Framework**: All vertical slices
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL**: Data persistence (all slices)
- **Redis**: Caching and session management (Infrastructure, User Auth)
- **JWT**: Authentication (User Auth, Infrastructure)
- **WooCommerce API**: Product and order data (Product Scanning, Point Management, Reward Catalog)

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Slices
1. **Infrastructure & Cross-cutting Concerns** - Foundation affects all other slices
2. **Admin Configuration & Management** - Complex WordPress integration requirements
3. **Product Scanning & Claim Processing** - Core business functionality with fraud considerations

### Medium-Risk Slices
1. **Point Management & Economy** - Financial implications of errors
2. **User Authentication & Registration** - Security-sensitive functionality
3. **Referral System** - Revenue impact from incorrect bonus distribution

### Low-Risk Slices
1. **Reward Catalog & Product Management** - Read-only functionality
2. **Order History & Redemption Tracking** - Read-only functionality
3. **Dashboard Analytics & User Insights** - Non-critical enhancement features

## Success Metrics by Slice

Each slice contributes to overall project success through measurable outcomes:

| Slice | Key Success Metric | Target |
|-------|-------------------|--------|
| User Authentication | Registration completion rate | >95% |
| Product Scanning | Scan processing time | <2 seconds |
| Point Management | Transaction accuracy | 100% |
| Referral System | Conversion tracking accuracy | 100% |
| Gamification | Achievement unlock rate | >99.9% |
| Rank Progression | Rank calculation accuracy | 100% |
| Reward Catalog | Product data availability | 99.9% uptime |
| User Profile | Update success rate | >99% |
| Order History | Data retrieval accuracy | 100% |
| Dashboard Analytics | Response time | <500ms |
| Admin Configuration | Configuration save success | >99% |
| Infrastructure | System uptime | 99.9% |

This vertical slice approach provides a structured pathway for migrating the CannaRewards system to Laravel while maintaining business continuity and minimizing risk.
