Step 1: Force Clear All Caches
This is the most likely suspect. Laravel heavily caches configuration, routes, and views. The settings package also has its own discovery cache. Let's clear everything to be certain we're working with a clean slate.
Run these commands in your terminal:
code
Bash
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan route:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan settings:clear-discovered
After running these, try loading the "Manage Settings" page again. If it works, the issue was caching.
Step 2: Verify the Database Record Manually
If clearing the cache didn't work, let's inspect the settings table directly to see what the seeder actually created.
Connect to your database.
Run this query: SELECT * FROM settings WHERE \group` = 'general';`
You should see exactly one row. Please check the following in that row:
group column: Must be general.
name column: This is critical. It must be the exact string App\Settings\GeneralSettings. Check for typos or incorrect backslashes.
payload column: This should be a valid JSON object containing all the keys defined in your GeneralSettings.php class. It should look something like this:
code
JSON
{"frontendUrl":"http://localhost","supportEmail":"support@example.com","welcomeRewardProductId":null,"referralSignupGiftId":null,"referralBannerText":"\ud83c\udf81 Earn More By Inviting Your Friends","pointsName":"Points","rankName":"Rank","welcomeHeaderText":"Welcome, {firstName}","scanButtonCta":"Scan Product"}
If this payload is null, an empty JSON object {}, or invalid JSON, it will cause the error.
Step 3: The "Scorched Earth" Fix (If Step 2 Reveals a Problem)
If the row is missing, malformed, or has the wrong name, let's delete it and recreate it cleanly.
Run php artisan tinker
Inside tinker, run this to delete any bad entry:
code
PHP
DB::table('settings')->where('group', 'general')->delete();
Exit tinker (Ctrl+D or exit).
Now, run the seeder again to create a fresh, correct entry:
code
Bash
php artisan db:seed --class=SettingsSeeder
Try accessing the settings page again. This combination almost always resolves data-related issues.
Step 4: A Small but Important Code Correction
Your GeneralSettings class has a booted() method. This method is only called when an instance of the class is created. The settings page works by resolving app(GeneralSettings::class), which can fail before booted() is called if no database row exists.
However, you can improve robustness by adding default values directly as class properties. This helps in contexts where an object might be instantiated without being saved first.
Modify app/Settings/GeneralSettings.php:
code
PHP
<?php

namespace App\Settings;

use Spatie\LaravelSettings\Settings;

class GeneralSettings extends Settings
{
    // Assign default values directly to the properties
    public string $frontendUrl = 'http://localhost';
    public string $supportEmail = 'support@example.com';
    public ?int $welcomeRewardProductId = null;
    public ?int $referralSignupGiftId = null;
    public string $referralBannerText = '🎁 Earn More By Inviting Your Friends';
    public string $pointsName = 'Points';
    public string $rankName = 'Rank';
    public string $welcomeHeaderText = 'Welcome, {firstName}';
    public string $scanButtonCta = 'Scan Product';

    public static function group(): string
    {
        return 'general';
    }

    // You can keep the booted method as a fallback, but the direct property defaults are more robust.
    public function booted(): void
    {
        // Now you can use config() to override the defaults if needed
        $this->fillMissing([
            'frontendUrl' => config('app.url', $this->frontendUrl),
        ]);
    }
}
This change makes the class more self-contained. After making this change, repeat Step 1 (Clear Caches) and Step 3 (Scorched Earth Fix) to ensure the new defaults are correctly seeded into the database.
Based on the symptoms and your feedback, my strong suspicion is either a caching issue (Step 1) or a malformed database entry (Step 2 & 3). Please try these steps in order, and one of them should resolve the error.
